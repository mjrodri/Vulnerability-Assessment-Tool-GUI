# Vulnerability Assessment Tool

## Overview

The Vulnerability Assessment Tool is a Python-based application designed for conducting basic vulnerability assessments on web applications and networks. It leverages OWASP ZAP for web application scanning and Nmap for network scanning. This tool provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## Features

- **Web Application Scanning:**
  - Utilizes OWASP ZAP for quick web vulnerability assessments.

- **Network Scanning:**
  - Uses Nmap to identify open ports on a specified IP address.

- **Graphical User Interface:**
  - Provides a user-friendly GUI for inputting web URLs and network IPs.

- **Scan Results Feedback:**
  - Displays feedback messages on scan completion, success, or errors.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- [OWASP ZAP CLI](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/ZAP-CLI)
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
